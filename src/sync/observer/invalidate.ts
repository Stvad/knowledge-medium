/**
 * Layout B observer — invalidation relocation (design doc §9.2).
 *
 * Under Layout B the observer is the single JS seam that applies every sync
 * write, so it invalidates DIRECTLY — subsuming the old `row_events` →
 * `rowEventsTail` round-trip. It already holds both sides of each change in
 * memory (the materialized `after`, and the pre-write `before` it reads for
 * the LWW gate), so it can feed them straight into the SAME helper the local
 * `repo.tx` fast path uses — `snapshotsToChangeNotification` — instead of
 * re-deriving them from a serialized audit row.
 *
 * One gate, not two: `materializeStagingRows` already consulted `ps_crud` /
 * `updated_at` to decide what to write to disk, so `snapshots` only contains
 * rows that won that gate. The remaining cache gate here is the in-memory LWW
 * (`applyIfNewer`), which also dedups fingerprint-identical re-deliveries — a
 * row the cache rejects produced no user-visible change, so (as in the old
 * tail) it contributes no invalidation, avoiding the re-read flicker that
 * waking handles to stale SQL would cause.
