 * event (for `preventDefault` / `stopPropagation` on the trailing
 * synthesized click, and logging).
 *
 * This is the ONLY thing a gesture needs to reach the action system, which is
 * what keeps the trigger vocabulary open: anything that can call `dispatchGesture`
 * publishes a gesture other plugins can bind actions to, facet or not. Returns
 * true when a bound action handled the gesture, false when none matched or every
 * candidate declined.
