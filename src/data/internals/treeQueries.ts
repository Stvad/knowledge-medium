/**
 * Recursive CTEs for tree operations against the v2 blocks schema (§11
 * of the data-layer redesign). Two guards on every recursion:
 *
 *   1. `depth < 100` — defensive cap. Catches pathological non-cycle
 *      deep trees and is the safety net if the visited-id guard fails.
 *
 *   2. `INSTR(path, '!' || hex(id) || '/') = 0` — visited-id check via
 *      path-INSTR. Skips any row whose id already appears in the
 *      recursion path-so-far. **Without this guard, UNION ALL would
 *      re-emit cycle members on every loop iteration**, exploding the
 *      result. With it, each block appears at most once.
 *
 * Path encoding: `!hex(id)/` segments separated by `<order_key>`.
 *   - `hex()` makes the path lexically safe regardless of id format
 *     (block ids may contain `/`; e.g. deterministic `daily/<ws>/<date>`).
 *   - `!` (0x21) is the in-segment separator: lexicographically less
 *     than every char in any order_key alphabet (digits, lowercase
 *     letters, `_`) AND every uppercase hex char (`0-9A-F`). This is
 *     what makes `ORDER BY path` produce correct sibling ordering when
 *     one order_key is a prefix of another (e.g. keys `a` and `aa` —
 *     comparing position-by-position, `a == a`, then `!` < `a` →
 *     `a!hex1/` sorts before `aa!hex2/`).
 *   - Trailing `/` per segment makes the visited-id INSTR match
 *     unambiguous (`!hex/` is found only as a complete segment, never
 *     as a prefix of a longer hex).
 *
 * Path is internal to the CTE; consumers ignore it.

/** Bounded scan over a set of affected ids — for each id, walks up

 *  sync-introduced cycles (§4.7 detection-only telemetry).
 *
 *  Parameter shape: pass `idCount` `?` placeholders bound to the ids
 *  to scan. Caller is responsible for matching the count.
 *
 *  Why report every cycle member, not just the input id that closed:
 *  drains can split per-row when sync-applied writes arrive in
 *  separate `db.onChange` ticks. For a 2-cycle A↔B introduced by two
 *  sync writes (A.parent←B, then B.parent←A), the drain that sees
 *  the first write scans `idList=[A]` against pre-second-write state
 *  and finds nothing; only the second drain (idList=[B], post-both-
 *  writes) sees the cycle. Reporting just `start_id` would emit
 *  `[B]` and lose A. Reporting the full cycle (`[A, B]`) gives
 *  consumers a complete view from any single drain that catches the
 *  closure, regardless of which member's mutation triggered the
 *  drain. The column alias stays `start_id` so the surface caller
 *  reads (`hits.map(h => h.start_id)`) is unchanged.
 *
 *  Why scoped to affected ids (not all blocks): cycle scans are O(n)
 *  per starting row and we don't need to find every cycle in the DB
 *  — only the ones the just-applied sync writes might have closed. */
