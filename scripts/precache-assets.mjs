/**
 * Enumerate every same-origin runtime asset the service worker serves
 * cache-first, so `inject-sw-build-id.mjs` can precache the WHOLE emitted
 * module graph into each generation's cache — not just the first-paint set.
 *
 * Why full precache (supersedes the old babel-only `precache-lazy-assets`
 * closure): the prod build ships modules at UNHASHED, stable URLs
 * (`preserveModules` + `[name].js`), so cross-build consistency rests
 * entirely on `public/sw.js` pinning each deploy to its own generation cache
 * and never grafting foreign-generation bytes onto a page. That invariant
 * only holds for assets that are actually IN the generation cache. Anything
 * lazy — e.g. the extension surface `src/extensions/api.js`, imported only at
 * runtime by user-extension blocks and therefore never first-painted — was
 * NOT precached, so on a cache miss the SW's network fallback
 * (`assetCacheFirst`) served the NEWEST generation's copy, grafting new bytes
 * onto an old page. When the new copy's exports drifted from the old page's
 * already-resolved siblings, the browser threw
 * `does not provide an export named …`. Precaching the full asset set closes
 * that gap (each page only ever reads its own complete generation) and, as a
 * bonus, makes the app fully offline-capable — every module it can lazily
 * import is already in Cache Storage.
 *
 * The extension set MIRRORS `public/sw.js`'s `ASSET_EXTENSION` /
 * `isCacheableAsset`: we precache EXACTLY what the SW serves from the
 * generation cache — no more. That deliberately excludes:
 *   - `*.map`   — dev/DevTools only (~30 MB), never fetched by the running app;
 *   - `sw.js`   — the worker itself, managed by the SW lifecycle, not imported;
 *   - `version.json`, `*.html`, `*.webmanifest` — not asset-typed; the shell is
 *     handled separately (network-first) and `version.json` must stay fresh.
 *
 * Pure + dependency-injected (`allFiles` / `toBaseUrl`) so it unit-tests
 * without touching a real dist tree.

 * URLs, so the HTTP cache holds this generation's bytes), and `rest` with
 * `{cache:'reload'}` (these unhashed URLs can hold a PRIOR deploy's bytes in
 * the HTTP cache, so a `default` fetch could copy stale cross-generation bytes
 * into this generation and reintroduce the very skew we're closing).
 *
 * Excluding first-paint keeps the SW from re-fetching (with `reload`) the URLs
 * `default` already covered for free. Output is base-prefixed to match the
 * first-paint URLs and how the SW resolves entries against its scope.
